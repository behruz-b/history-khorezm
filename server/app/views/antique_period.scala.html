                                <p class="mar-bottom">The Khorezm region, one of the first centers of world civilization, is distinguished by its unique cultural traditions, which have their ancient roots. The Khorezm oasis, located in the confluence of the Amu Darya and the Aral Sea, one of the lifebloods of Central Asia, has been the cradle of life for our ancestors since ancient times.</p>
                                <p>One of the medieval scholars, Istakhri, commented on the Amudarya, saying that "Khorezm is a country that could benefit from the whole of Jaihun." This idea is reminiscent of Herodotus' statement about Egypt. Herodotus, the "father of history" who lived in the 5th century BC, considered the whole of Egypt to be the "gift of the Nile." Ya.Gulamov “History of irrigation in Khorezm. (From ancient times to the present) ” and speaks of the Amudarya and its delta as very similar to the two great rivers above. Thanks to these rivers, primitive man was able to live within the vast deserts. The lakes formed as a result of the overflow of these rivers and their tributaries, as well as the tugai and changalzars, provided the people with much of what they needed during all periods of social development. For thousands of years, the peoples living in the oases have waged a fierce struggle against the mobile sands and water regime changes that have swept across both rivers. They conquered deserts and rivers and built flourishing oases.</p>

                            <p>Khorezm is a historical region located between Turan and Iran. Its territory in ancient times stretched from the mouths of the Amudarya to the south to the upper reaches of the Murgab and Tajan rivers. Therefore, this ancient historical region is known in science by two names: Ancient Khorezm and Greater Khorezm. The first information about Khorezm can be found in the books of Avesto, Bihistun by Darius 1, ancient Greek authors (Hecate, Herodotus, Strabo, etc.) and in the works of early medieval Arab geographers.</p>
                            <p>In the "Yasht" part of the Avesta, Khorezm is praised as "a river of a thousand streams", "a land rich in lakes and meadows". The territory of ancient Khorezm is naturally divided into 2 regions. In its northern part, in the foothills of the Amu Darya, there are countless wetlands, vast plains to the north and northeast, and in the south, a large part of the valleys of the Murgab and Tajan rivers in the foothills of mountains and hills. fertile lands.</p>
                            <p>The Khorezm oasis occupies the plain on the right and left banks of the Amudarya delta. Only the southernmost part of the oasis in Tuyamoy is the middle reaches of the Amudarya. Here is a small Pitnak oasis in the sands of the Karakum Desert, on the left bank of the Arctic.</p>
                            <p>Approaching the oasis, there are Karakum hills and barkhan sands that move easily under the influence of wind. The name Karakum, according to VI Masalsky, is not given by the color of the sands, but by their desolate, lifeless appearance. According to Ya. Gulyamov, the name actually means "evil sands". The Khorezmians have been passing through these sands since ancient times and have been in constant contact with Khorasan and other parts of Iran.</p>
                            <p>The oasis on the right bank is bordered on the northeast by the Southern and Western Kyzylkum. The relief of the Kyzylkum surface is closely related to the tectonics of the Cretaceous rocks that make it up. Kyzylkum and Karakum sands do not differ from each other in terms of their origin and geological formation. They consist mainly of two sands formed by the mainland and alluvially. The first of these, reddish-yellow, or rather reddish-gray, was formed only as a result of the erosion and flight of macteric rocks under the influence of wind. The second type of sand is gray and originates in an alluvial way, i.e., it is formed mainly by the windsweptness of riverbeds and coastal dunes.</p>
