                                <p>According to Beruni's list of 22 generations of the Sioux dynasty, the era of the new Khorezm dynasty begins with the reign of King Afrig, the youngest, or rather the last, dynasty of the dynasty. The accession of Afrigiys to the throne dates back to 305 AD. From this period until 995, the Afrigiys ruled on the throne of Khorezm.</p>

                            <p>Khorezm retained its political independence both during the Hephthalite period (second half of the 5th century - middle of the 6th century) and the Turks (second half of the 6th century - first half of the 7th century). The Byzantine historian Menander gives incomplete information that Khorezm established diplomatic relations with Byzantium and the Turks in the 1960s.</p>
                            <p>Arab sources state that Khorezm was twice conquered by the Arab generals Salim ibn Ziyad and Umayn ibn Abdullah. In fact, looting raids were carried out on these lands, as was the case with the cities of Movaraunnahr. Only at the beginning of the VIII century the armies led by the viceroy of Khorasan Qutayba ibe Muslim completely conquered Khorezm. Qutayba exterminates and persecutes the scholars who created and preserved the historical literature and cultural heritage of the Khorezmians. Therefore, there are not enough written sources on the history of the pre-Arab state of Khorezm.</p>
                            <p>From 712 to 730, a group of supporters of Khurzod, the brother of the Khorezmshah, who had been brutally oppressed and persecuted by the Arabs, moved to the territories of the Caspian Khanate, where they took control of the army and the state. They are strengthening their military position and threatening the lands occupied by the Arabs in the Caucasus.</p>
                            <p>During this period, the Urgench Valley and the Khorezm state were directly subordinated to the caliphate, each paying a separate tribute. The rulers of the Khorezm state took a number of measures to strengthen their position. Information about the arrival of the ambassadors of Khorezmshah Shaushfir to China in 751 has been preserved.</p>
                            <p>Depressed by strong earthquakes, the Khorezm state was under the rule of the Tahirids, Saffarids and Samanids, the largest independent states that emerged in Central Asia and Eastern Iran in the IX-X centuries due to the collapse of the Arab Caliphate.</p>
                            <p>As for the cultural and spiritual changes of the African period, the Khorezmians continued their religious-philosophical, scientific and artistic work, which was formed in antiquity. Beruni in his book "Monuments of ancient peoples" reports that the Khorezm people had a calendar-calendar system adapted to pre-Islamic irrigated agriculture. “The people of Khorezm are in line with the Sogdian people at the beginning of the year and the months are in opposition to the Iranians. The customs of the Khorezmians are similar to those of the Sogdians, in whom the beginning of summer is the beginning of the new year, ”Beruni said.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the stars of the constellation Beruni, it shows that in ancient Khorezm the notions of celestial lights were much more perfect. Beruni notes that "the Khorezmians knew the constellations better than the Arabs." Beruni proves with evidence that the stars in some constellations are correctly represented in the Khorezmians in relation to the Arabs. The above data show that scientific knowledge developed in Khorezm in the morning.</p>
                            <p>The rich scientific and cultural heritage created in the ancient and early Middle Ages in the country plays an important role in the cultural development of Central Asia and Khorezm during the Renaissance.</p>
                            <p>It is known that the beginning of the IX-XIII centuries is known in the history of the peoples of the East as the Eastern Renaissance or "Islamic Renaissance". This period is characterized by high socio-economic, cultural, scientific and educational development in the Middle East, Central Asia, Khorezm, Khorasan, Iran, North India and neighboring countries, which were previously part of the caliphate. First of all, the material and spiritual foundations of this rise were connected with the development of the productive forces of feudal society at that time, and its material basis was created during the caliphate. By the ninth century, a group of famous Oriental scholars, thinkers, and translators working in the natural and human sciences in the capital, Baghdad, had made a tremendous contribution to the development of world science with their invaluable works. The economic and cultural upsurge of the Renaissance was also due to the separation of Central Asia, Khorasan, and the Arab Caliphate from Iran, the emergence of independent states in these regions, the cessation of hostilities, and the Enlightenment rulers' focus on economic and cultural development. At that time, a number of cities in the East, including Baghdad, Damascus, Nishapur, Ray, Jurjan, Merv, Bukhara, Samarkand, Kot, Gurganj, Khiva and others became famous not only as centers of trade, handicrafts, but also science and enlightenment. The Bayt ul-Hikma, one of the first academies of the East in Baghdad in the ninth century, was founded by scholars who worked at the institute.</p>
                            <p>Most of them, including Muhammad al-Khorezmi, Ahmad al-Farghani, Ahmad al-Marwazi, Abbas al-Jawhari, and others, were well-known scholars and thinkers who grew up in the lands of Movarounnahr and Khorezm. The invaluable works and scientific discoveries created by them later became the spiritual basis for the achievements of the team of scientists of the Khorezm Mamun Academy in the field of theoretical and applied sciences. Beruni, Abu Nasr ibn Iraq, and Ibn Sina are pleased to note that in their research they have made extensive use of the works of the scholars of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, Indian and ancient Greek scholars and thinkers. In particular, the names of ancient Greek thinkers such as Aristotle, Ptolemy, Euclid, Hippocrates, Galen, Pythagoras are mentioned with reverence.</p>
                            <p>In fact, our compatriot Muhammad al-Khorezmi (783-850) was one of the leading scholars, scientific advisers of Bayt ul-Hikma, one of the scholars who created a new direction and school in science. He left dozens of works in the fields of astronomy, mathematics, geography, history and other sciences. His book Al-jabr val-muqabala was one of the first works in the world to establish the science of algebra. The scientist created a decimal positional system in mathematics. On this basis, he taught the East and Europe advanced computer systems, discovering a convenient and easy way of the practice of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The concept of algorithm, a mathematical concept that refers to any regular, consistent computational process in science, is also directly related to the name of al-Khorezmi, as the Latin name of the scientist was changed to "Algorithm", "Algorithm" in the West.</p>
