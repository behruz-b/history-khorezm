                            <p>n ancient Khorezm, the ethnos mentioned in the sources under the name of Khorasmi was formed in the last quarter of the second millennium BC. This ethnos has been a people united in terms of territorial and linguistic unity since that time. Abu Rayhan Beruni in his work "Osor ul-baqiya anal urun al-kholiya" gives interesting information about the history of statehood of ancient Khorezm. That is, this date, which began in Khorezm in the tradition of local history, the royal dynasty called the Siyavushi, from one thousand two hundred and ninety-two BC, serves to explain another important historical event. The fact is that when we talk about ancient Khorezm, in science we come across the concept of Greater Khorezm. This concept was conditionally introduced in the twentieth century by the German scientist J. Marquardt, and is based on data recorded by Herodotus and other ancient Greek authors. According to this, the land inhabited by the ancient Khorezmians was between Parthia and Bactria, that is, between modern Khorasan. The year 1292 BC indicated by Beruni is interpreted as the year when the Khorezmians settled in the present Khorezm oasis. The historical truth of this information seems to have been proved by Beruni in the list of the royal dynasty of that period, which consisted of 22 generations.</p>
                            <p>Zoroastrianism is a sacred book of religion of the 6th century BC, which is the main source for studying the ancient culture, beliefs, language, literature and partial history of the peoples of Iran and Central Asia. There are different opinions about the place where the work was written. A group of scholars say that the French J. Darmsteter, the Azerbaijani scientist I. Aliyev said that the "Avesta" Media was written in the northwestern part of modern Iran and Azerbaijan, most of them were V.V. Struve, S.P. in the provinces, between Balkh and Khorezm. The latter idea has recently been acknowledged by Iranian scholars, such as Ibrahim Pur Dawud. The text of the Avesta has not been fully preserved. To us, only a very small part of it has arrived.</p>
                            <p>Information about the foundation of the first Uzbek statehood can be found first in the Avesta and in the encyclopedic scholar Abu Rayhan Beruni's monuments of ancient peoples, written 1000 years ago, as well as in the materials of archeological research in the Khorezm oasis. In particular, the discovery of the oldest Zoroastrian temple in Central Asia at the Khumbuztepa monument in 2013, as well as the fact that the 2700th anniversary of the Avesto was held in Khorezm, confirms our opinion.</p>
                            <p>The data and archeological materials in the Avesta show that property and social inequality arose in the society of that time, the process of transition from the primitive community system to the class society began, and in some more developed regions the first states began to form.</p>
                            <p>The process of formation of a class society and the first statehood in Central Asia was very slow. The formation of the first statehood in Khorezm took a long time. Beruni points out that its roots go back to the 12th century BC. The process went through two stages. The first stage is mil.avv. From the XII century to the VIII century, the 2nd stage BC. It lasted from the VIII century to the VI century, that is, until the invasion of the Achaemenids of Iran. According to Beruni, in the first stage, with the migration of Siyavush, the son-in-law of Afrosiab, the king of Turan, his son Kay Khusrav and their descendants to Khorezm, the process of gradual unification into a single kingdom began.</p>
                            <p>According to Beruni, the Turkic tribes are one of the oldest ethnic groups in Khorezm, and the Khorezm people are mainly descended from this ethnos, which is why they consider the ancient Turkic tribes as their ancestors. Most of the tribes living in the Khorezm oasis lived a sedentary life. The part of the population living in cities and villages was engaged in trade, handicrafts and agriculture. The population living in the desert sand zone of the oasis was semi-settled or nomadic, engaged in hunting and cattle breeding.</p>
                            <p>The first step of the Avesto heroes Siyavush and his son, Kay Khusrav, who was awarded the title of the first Khorezmshah, to establish the first statehood in Khorezm was to unite the Turkic Sak-Massaget tribes living in this country into a single kingdom. After completing this task, Siyavush set out to build a large, powerful and centralized state in the future, uniting the Aryan tribes living in the basins of the Tajan and Murgab rivers and in the foothills of the Turkmen-Khurasan Mountains. This is stated in the Avesta's poem "Osha", paragraph 41 of part VIII: "Mard and businessman Khusrav, who united the Aryan countries, came to Osha."</p>
                            <p>So, when the first Khorezmshah Kay Khusrav (1200-1140) began to unite the lands around Khorezm inhabited by Aryans (Khorezmians were also a part of Aryans), then this work was continued by his descendants.</p>
                            <p>The historical conditions that arose at that time created even more favorable conditions for the Siyavush to achieve this goal. By the first half of the 1st millennium BC, significant changes had taken place in the economic, political and ethnographic map of Central Asia, including Uzbekistan. Sogdiana and Khorezm regions were inhabited by tribes and ethnic groups (mainly Aryans) engaged in agriculture based on artificial irrigation.</p>
                            <p>Historically, Persian-speaking tribes, including the Aryans and the so-called Khorezmians, have repeatedly migrated to the Khorezm oasis.</p>
                            <p>The first migration Beruni points out is that  it happened in the XIII century BC. According to him, in 1292 BC, some people came to the Khorezm oasis and began to settle there. The second migration was in in the XII century  BC Siyavush, his son Kay Khusrav and their descendants came to Khorezm. The third migration  it occurred as a result of the invasions of the kings of Assyria and Media in Iran and Central Asia during the VIII-VII centuries BC.</p>
                            <p>The fourth migration took place during the reign of the Achaemenids of Iran. In the 6th century BC, the Achaemenid king Darius conquered Khorezm and moved the Khorezmian tribes from Khorasan to the Khorezm oasis in order to consolidate his rule there, where he established farming communities. In later periods, such migrations or forced relocations were common.</p>
                            <p>Ancient Greek historians and geographers (Herodotus, Hecate, Strabo) migrated from Khorasan with the Aryan tribes called "Khorasmians" and mixed with the Sak-Massaget tribes living in the Khorezm oasis for a long time.</p>
                            <p>Existing written sources, archeological researches, legends and myths confirm this idea by scientists who have been conducting archeological researches in Khorezm oasis for many years. Including S.P. Tolstov and M.A. In the article Itina it is said that at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC , Khorezm was invaded by the Suyargan tribes from the southern agricultural regions of Central Asia.</p>
                            <p>Archaeologist B.I. Wow. According to Iber, . During the migration in the VIII-VII centuries BC, some of the Khorasmians moved to the Lower Amudarya, and most - to the Akchadarya.</p>
                            <p>The Arab geographer al-Muqaddas, in his book The Best Guide to the Study of Climates, tells of Khorezm, where a large group of people from Khorasan were expelled and settled.</p>
                            <p>According to Yaqut al-Hamawi, an Arab traveler and geographer who visited Khorezm in 1219-1220, “the people of Khorezm built houses, palaces, buildings, multiplied and enriched themselves in this region. They built villages and towns and became famous for their neighboring Khorasanians. The Khorasanians moved in and settled there.</p>
                            <p>Thus, in the first quarter of the 1st millennium BC, the end of the Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age, as a result of the merger of various Turkic and Persian-Tajik ethnic groups living in the Khorezm oasis during the long historical development, The Khorezmian people were formed.</p>
                            <p>The Siyavush dynasty relied on this people and laid the foundation of the first Khorezm statehood. However, the statehood that began to take shape at that time could not be considered a full-fledged state. Only its first buds were formed.</p>
                            <p>Later, class stratification intensified in society, and along with free collectives, a class of slaves and nobles was formed, and the conflict between them intensified. A strong centralized state became necessary to keep the working masses in obedience and to protect the homeland from external enemies. The process of creating such a state took place in BC and  it came to an end in the VIII century.</p>
                            <p>According to the Avesta, the Siyavush dynasty managed to unite a large number of peoples and territories, especially the regions inhabited by Aryan tribes, around Khorezm and create a large state system based on the principles of military-democratic confederation.</p>
                            <p>Herodotus A. Markwart, Richard Fray, W. Tarn, S.P. According to Tolstoy and Gulyamov, before the Achaemenid invasion (VI century BC) in Central Asia there was a powerful "Great Khorezm" and the ancient state of Bactria.</p>
                            <p>The Greater Khorezm Conference included Sogdiana (Zarafshan Valley) and Khorasan (Southern Turkmenistan, Northeastern Iran, Western Afghanistan). V. Markwart, V. Bartold, SP Tolstov, Ya.</p>
                            <p>n the 6th century BC, as a result of the invasion of the Achaemenids of Iran, the state association "Greater Khorezm" disbanded. The Achaemenids ruled Central Asia for up to 200 years. In the 4th century BC, Achaemenid rule in Central Asia ended and Khorezm became an independent state.</p>
